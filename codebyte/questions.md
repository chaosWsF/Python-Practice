## Q1: SQL Vendor Sort

Your table: maintable_2RSJL

MySQL version: 8.0.23

In this MySQL challenge, your query should return the vendor information along with the values from the table 
cb_vendorinformation. You should combine the values of the two tables based on the GroupID column. The final
query should consolidate the rows to be grouped by FirstName, and a Count column should be added at the end
