"""
Given an array of integers nums sorted in ascending order, find the starting 
and ending position of a given target value.

If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

Follow up: Could you write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity?

Example 1:

    Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
    Output: [3,4]

Example 2:

    Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
    Output: [-1,-1]

Example 3:

    Input: nums = [], target = 0
    Output: [-1,-1]

Constraints:
    1. 0 <= nums.length <= 105
    2. -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
    3. nums is a non-decreasing array.
    4. -109 <= target <= 109
